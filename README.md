# Branch a 
Implemented add-to-cart using Javascript AJAX  
"Add to cart" grey & disabled when no stock.
Added instrucion on cart page, couldnot implemtment it to make it appear in order notes because of error "This store canâ€™t accept payments right now.". Successful orders cannot be made in this stage so order is never complete.
